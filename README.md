# Vagrant VM configuration tool

A small tool for specifying and configuring a multiple machine
environment using the virtual machine management and
automation tool, Vagrant, from a YAML or JSON file or a ERB
templating file that generates a YAML or JSON output. Multiple
configuration files can also be cascaded and merged together
dynamically to composite machines using the `includes` property or
the `--configs` option.

## Getting Started

### Global Installation

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
2. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
3. Clone this repository
4. Add the `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable
5. Create your configuration files in a location of your choice,
   see [Configuring the Environment](#config).

   **Note:** You must have the root configuration file as `vagrant.yml`
   or `vagrant.json` in the current working directory.

6. Run the command:

   ```bash
   bash vagrant.sh [options] up [vm]
   ```

### Embedded Installation

1. Do a global installation (up to Step 4)
2. In the project that you want to embedded this tool, run commands:

   ```bash
   bash vagrant_embed.sh [options]
   ```

3. Create your configuration files in `.vagrant/configurations`,
   see [Configuring the Environment](#config).

   **Note:** You must have the root configuration file as `vagrant.yml`
   or `vagrant.json` in the `configurations` directory.

4. Add the `Vagrantfile` and configuration files to your project's git.
5. Use Vagrant like normal (i.e.: `vagrant up`).

## <a name="config"></a> Configuring the Environment

To create or configure a single or multiple virtual machine
environment, create a `vagrant.yml` based on the documentation provided
in [`vagrant.doc.yml`](docs/vagrant.doc.yml) file. Sample configurations
can be found in the `samples` directory.

**Note:** Not all Vagrant features are implemented, yet.

## Requirements

* [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

## Experimental

### Provision Locally

To provision the environment specified by the `vagrant.yml` or 
`vagrant.json` locally on a host machine, run the command:

```bash
bash run_local.sh [vm]
```

**Note**: Being an experimental feature, not all provisioning mechanisms are
currently implemented, only the file and shell provisioners. Only works on
Linux based systems. The virtual machine's home directory is mapped to the
current user's home directory. Installs RVM and Ruby as a prerequisite.

**Use at your own risk.**
